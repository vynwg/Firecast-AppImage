# Firecast AppImage

Firecast is a Online TTRPG software and can be found at [firecast.app](https://firecast.app/). 

Please note that this is an unofficial redistribution of the software and **may be outdated** as it's needed to manually update the binaries contained in here. This repository simply bundles [WINE](https://www.winehq.org/), [winetricks](https://github.com/Winetricks/winetricks) and Firecast into an AppDir structure. 

Direct downloads to the built AppImage can be found in the Releases page.

Created with the help of [RazZziel/PortableLinuxGames](https://github.com/RazZziel/PortableLinuxGames)'s WINE bundling scripts.
